Words of Auspiciousness to Accomplish One's Aims: A Praise to Lady Tārā Namastāraye! By merely hearing your name, Beings are freed from saṃsāra's ocean. Enraptured by this wondrous miracle, I supplicate you with total devotion. Your gorgeous form is adorned with virtuous marks, Like millions of powdered emeralds piled up high. May you display this splendid form before my eyes, With a hundred peacefully smiling expressions. From the accomplishment of your secret vidyā mantra, An ocean of precious treasures, Siddhis, both mundane and supramundane, wells forth. Thus, may you grant benefit and bliss throughout the three planes. Basic space is profound and sublime peace. It is free of directions and parts. When bestowing your blessings, at that very moment, Make duality dissolve into the central channel! Most especially, for all of us living in dread of the decline Of these dark and degenerate times, Mother of All Victors, day and night I turn to you. I know no other protection than you. So, extend your hand of compassion, Dispel all my fears, And grant me the bountiful fortune Of finding relief in a perfect realm. In the meantime, I beseech you, make the qualities of the four perfections Blossom with blazing beauty, And laden with such abundance, The indivisible three kāyas are ultimately unified. In short, from now until awakening, May I remain forever Under Noble Tārā's joyful gaze, And thus may the beautiful picture of all desired aims be perfected. These small flowers of auspicious supplication were scattered by the vidyādhara Mañjughoṣa to grant some relief to those living in dread of the decline of these dark times. Grant your blessings that these aspirations be fulfilled! Sarvadā śreyo bhavatu.
